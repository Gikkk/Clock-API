The challenge
Your challenge is to build out this clock application and get it looking as close to the design as possible. You'll be using the following APIs to retrieve the necessary data:

IP Geolocation API to set the city and country underneath the time
Programming Quotes API to generate random programming quotes.
You can use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.

Your users should be able to:

View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
View the current time and location information based on their IP address
View additional information about the date and time in the expanded state
Be shown the correct greeting and background image based on the time of day they're visiting the site
Generate random programming quotes by clicking the refresh icon near the quote
